<h1>Report nr.3 of Team 4 for the 13th of November</h1>
<h2>Frontend:</h2>
The Frontend tried to work on the cards for the offers from the providers.
We figured out two prototypes. One for the web application <b>image 1</b> and one for the mobile application <b>image 2</b>.<br>

<img src="Web_Cards_Prototype.jpg" width="210.75" height="123.75"/><br>
Also we extended our Profile page. We can now see if whats the username you're currently logged in with and if you're a provider or a consumer.
<br>***Insert Screenshot of the Profile Page***
<br>
Instead of the Login Button on the top right, we implementet a Refresh Button and a Button where you can redirect to the Profile page.

<h3>Problems:</h3>
We couldn't implement pictures in the cards. We discussed this problem and we agreed, that there are only gonna implement a few default pictures to describe the offers. 
The design of the web/mobile application still lacks appeal. This is okay. We discussed that we are focusing on the main functionality first, before extending the graphical design.
<h2>Backend:</h2>
It's now possible to view your username when logged in. It's visible in the picture below:

***Insert Screenshot where u can see your username on the homepage***

Also we implemented Session Tokens.
<h3>Problems:</h3>
We started to test. Unfortunately it's no yet functioning as we expected it to do.
